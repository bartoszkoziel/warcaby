# Warcaby online (Checkers online)
Simple recreation of checkers online made with ThreeJS and ExpressJS framework.To communicate between clients and server I am using fetch and SocketIO.

## Setup
Download the repo and install the required libraries. To do this, run "npm install" in the main catalog. After that run "node ./server.js" and you are good to go! The server runs on port 3000 by default, but you can change it in "server.js" file.
